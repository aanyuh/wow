                <p>Amazing. Just AH-MAY-ZING! I mean, to impress a hair professional like myself is an incredible feat, but to make me so satisfied so as to leave a review is a different amount of prowess altogether! Keep doing what you do. You're bound for success.</p>

                <p>Being a hijabi is not easy when you're getting your hair treated, but the staff at Hair House were so considerate and versatile. I come here ALLLLLLL the time guys, to the point where I even recomended it to my boyfriend ðŸ˜‚ We go here for couple hair spas to the point where I'm pretty sure we come here more than the grocery store LOL<p>

                <p>i came here under my fav influencer seraphine's promotion and im honestly so glad i did; they are all i hoped for and more. i actually ended up meeting one of my childhood friends that i had been looking for for years here, so now i have a sentimental attatchment to the place. not to mention i loved my cut and the staff were so nice â™¡</p>
