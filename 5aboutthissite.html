    <h1>General Site Info</h1>
    <p>The Hair Salon Website Mockup is a web development project aimed at creating a dynamic and interactive online presence for a fictional hair salon. This project leverages HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP to simulate the functionality of a real hair salon website.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Real-World Application: Creating a mock hair salon website allows for practical application of web development skills in a scenario that mimics real-world client projects.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Multi-Technology Integration: This project integrates multiple web technologies, providing an opportunity to practice and demonstrate proficiency in HTML for structure, CSS for styling, JavaScript for interactivity, and PHP for server-side functionality.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">User Experience Focus: By designing the website for a hair salon, the project emphasizes user experience and user interface design, requiring careful consideration of visual aesthetics and ease of navigation.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Client Interaction: Implementing features like appointment booking and user logins simulate the need for client-stylist interactions and database management, which are common in websites for service-based businesses.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Responsive Design: The project involves responsive design to ensure the website functions seamlessly on various devices, enhancing accessibility and user engagement.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Database Management: Incorporating PHP for handling user authentication and appointment management involves working with databases, a critical skill for web developers.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Creative Freedom: Designing a mock website for a hair salon offers creative freedom in choosing visuals, color schemes, and overall aesthetics, allowing for personal expression and design experimentation.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        In summary, the Hair Salon Website Mockup project serves as a practical exercise in web development, combining various technologies and emphasizing user-centric design and functionality. It provides a valuable opportunity to gain hands-on experience in creating a functional and visually appealing website.

        <h1>Bonus Mark Allocation</h1>
        <p>
            <h2>Base criteria</h2>
            I have included the following properties that constitute bonus marks:
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Excellent Javascript functionality (integrated it into nearly every aspect of my project)</li> 
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Well commented HTML / CSS and  javascript</li> 
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Use of an external CSS file to ensure a consistent look and feel of the site and easy changes to the appearance of the entire site.</li> 
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Efforts to make the site “responsive”.</li> 
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">All but one component of the site is original. The slideshow code was resourced online (at https://www.educative.io/answers/how-to-create-an-automatic-slideshow-with-html-css-and-js) due to errors encountered with my own code and popular codes from other sites. Finding the code required a lot of searching. If it was not for my device's error, this code would as well be original.</li> 
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Original artwork and photos (slideshow photos all designed by yours truly, most images required a lot of resizing and personalised formatting beforehand)</li> 
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Cohesive overall appearance and consistency.</li> 

            <h2>Extra criteria</h2>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">I learnt a whole new coding language (PHP) for the completion of elements of this task.</li> 
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Immense dedication to making even the most boring pages interesting and responsive.</li> 
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">I had to restart my whole project less than a week away from the due date due to CDN errors.</li> 
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Professional look and feel (I aimed to make it somewhat reminiscent of a pitch for a website I would submit to an actual company rather than a school project)</li> 
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">No body text or code is generated by AI in order to make it topical and personalised.</li> 
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">User experience is taken into account incredibly - all is tested by external parties to make sure the interface is desirable.</li>
